## NORMAL TARGETS ##

xxx_defconfig            - Configure buildroot to build, for example:
                           make c20_defconfig

build                    - Compile buildroot, and assemble all Cambricon project
                           packages (package/*) 

clean                    - Clean all build materials and output artifacts.

## Package-specific ##

pkg-<pkgname>
host-<pkgname>-%         - Run a target inside of buildroot (for the target
                           system or for the host system), for example:
                              make pkg-linux-rebuild
                           Or:
                              make host-pkg-foo-dirclean

<pkgname>-rebuild        - Restart the build from the build step
<pkgname>-dirclean       - Remove <pkg> build directory

<pkgname>-depends        - Build <pkgname>'\''s dependencies
<pkgname>-show-depends   - List packages on which <pkgname> depends
<pkgname>-show-rdepends  - List packages which have <pkgname> as a dependency

## UTILITY TARGETS ##

flush-rootfs             - Force buildroot the restage all files in the target
                           filesystem, useful to ensure the assembled filesystem
                           image is consistent.
rebuild-chagned          - Run the buildroot target `<package>-rebuild` for all
                           external projects that have changed in the current
                           source tree.
